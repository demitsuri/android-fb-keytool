This is small lightweight utility for generating key hash for mobile apps integrated with Facebook. You don't need openssl or JDK, just JRE. All command line parameters have names like in JDK keytool.

For help just run this utility:
`java -jar ./android-fb-keytool.jar`
or
`java -jar ./android-fb-keytool.jar -h`
or
`java -jar ./android-fb-keytool.jar -help`
